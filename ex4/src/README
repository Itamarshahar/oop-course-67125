The Trees Package (Q.9.2.4.1):
    1.Interface ResponsiveToJump
        This interface represents object that are responsive to the Avatar's
        jumps. The classes that implement this interface implements a methods
        called onJump(), which determine the behavior of the object after the
        jump.
    2. class Flora:
        This Facade class that represents the flora object of the game, e.g -
        handle the creation of the trunk, the leaves, and the fruits in a given
        interval.
    3. class Trunk extends Block implements ResponsiveToJump:
        Represents the trunk of the tree. It extends Block and implements the
        ResponsiveToJump interface, and onJump
        the trunk changes it's color.
    4. class Fruit extends GameObject implements ResponsiveToJump:
        Represents a fruit on the tree. Implements ResponsiveToJump, and onJump
        the fruit changes it's color. The fruit, update method handle the
        collision of the Avatar with the fruit. In the collision the fruit give
        more energy to the Avatar. After a day cycle, the removed fruits are
        placed back at the tree top.
    5. class Leaf extends GameObject implements ResponsiveToJump:
        Represents a leaf on the tree. Implements ResponsiveToJump, and onJump
        the leaf rotate in 90 degrees.

The relationships within the trees Package (Q.9.2.4.2):
    1. The Trunk, Leaf, and Fruit classes extend GameObjects, and implement the
     DidJumpObserver interface.
    2. The GameManger initialize the Flora class,
    3. The Flora class creates the trunk, leaves, and fruits, and adds them
    into as game-objects.
    4. callback functions are given by the PepseGAmeManager to the Flora class,
        and from the Flora class passed to the Trunk, Leaf, Fruit classes. Each
        class gets the callback functions it needs.
    5. The Trunk, Leaf, and Fruit classes observe the Avatar class(the subject)
        The observers are added to the Avatar at the Flora class,
        when the creating the flora using the appropriate method.

Design Patterns(Q.9.2.4.3):
    1. The Leaf, Fruit, and Trunk are both GameObject and observers to the
        Avatar (the subject).
    2. The Flora class is Facade classes, concealing the
    complexity of the creation of trunk, the leafs, and the fruits
