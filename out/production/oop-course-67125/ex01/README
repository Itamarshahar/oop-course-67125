Q1:
My strategy for the automatic players:
1. The GeniusPlayer strategy focuses on placing marks on the diagonal positions of the board.
Diagonal positions can participate in the most potential winning streaks,
 making them the most valuable locations.
By targeting the diagonal, the GeniusPlayer not only maximizes its own chances
of winning, but also helps to block the opponent's potential winning moves.
2. The CleverPlayer strategy alternates between two approaches random
Positioning For one turn, the CleverPlayer places its mark in a random,
available position on the board.
On the next turn, the CleverPlayer focuses on completing an entire row, column,
 or diagonal with its marks.
3. Whatever: The WhateverPlayer strategy is to locate randomly.

Q2:
The advantage of designing the software in this manner is that it promotes
modularity and flexibility.
When we want to add a new player type or modify an existing one, we can do
so without having to change the entire codebase.
The modular design allows us to make point-wise changes to the specific
components that require updating, rather than having to touch the rest
of the software.
